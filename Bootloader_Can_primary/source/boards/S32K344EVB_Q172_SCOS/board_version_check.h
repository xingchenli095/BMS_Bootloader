/* This OS application template is build for
 * EB tresos AutoCore OS 6.1.113.
 *
 * Parts of the application template, which is delivered together with the OS, depend on the OS implementation.
 * The following checks make sure that the OS application template is used together with
 * EB tresos AutoCore OS 6.1.113.
 *
 * To update the application template to a new OS version, make sure that at least all files
 * which include this file are updated to match the requirements of the new OS version.
 * This is mainly related to the preconditions on hardware setup which have to be met before calling StartOS().
 * These preconditions can be found by
 *  - comparing all your start-up code with the template code shipped with the new OS version
 *  - reading the manuals and architecture notes of the respective operating systems.
